You are given a CSV file named timesheet.csv, where each row represents an employee‚Äôs work hours for a day:

Edit
employee_id,date,clock_in,clock_out
‚úÖ Your Task
Read the file timesheet.csv.

Validate each row:

employee_id must be a 6-digit number.

date must be a valid YYYY-MM-DD date.

clock_in and clock_out must be valid HH:MM 24-hour times.

clock_out must be after clock_in.

Skip invalid rows, and for each invalid row:

Write the line number and reason into a log file called errors.log.

For valid rows, calculate hours worked (rounded to 2 decimal places).

Write all valid results into valid_timesheet.csv in this format:

bash
Copy
Edit
employee_id,date,hours_worked
